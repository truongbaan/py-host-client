# ðŸ“„ Notes about the EXE Files

There are two executable (`.exe`) files included:

---

### 1. **ClientUI EXE (UI Client)**
- This executable is based on `client6.py`.
- It adds a **Tkinter-based UI** for easier interaction.
- Functionality is the same as `client6.py`, but with a more user-friendly interface.

---

### 2. **Payload EXE (Host + Dropper)**
- This executable wraps `host6.py` inside a **dropper**.
- It **assumes that Python is already installed** on the machine.
- It **creates temporary `.py` files** during execution. Because of this behavior, **it would be flagged as a Trojan** by antivirus software.
- This design is intentional:  
  Only users with knowledge of programming and Python should attempt to run it.

# âš™ Requirements for Running the Payload EXE
- **Python must be installed** on the machine.
- All required **Python libraries must also be installed** (e.g., `keyboard`, `cv2`, etc.). Please follow the Installation in the README file.
- You **cannot** run the payload EXE directly inside **system-protected folders** (e.g., `C:\Windows` or even directly on `C:\`).  
  It is recommended to run it **on a different drive** (for example, `D:\`, `E:\`, etc.).
