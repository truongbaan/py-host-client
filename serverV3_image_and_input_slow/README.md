# Remote Desktop and Input Controller via TCP

## Description

This Python project implements a remote desktop and remote input control system. The host computer streams its screen to one or more client devices, and clients send their keyboard events back to the host. The host then simulates these key presses using the **pyautogui** library. This setup is ideal for experiments or demonstrations of socket programming, image streaming, and remote control over local networks.

**Important:**

> **Do not run the host and client on the same computer** as the host uses pyautogui to simulate key presses, which may interfere with normal input operations.

## Features

- **Real-time Screen Streaming:**\
  The host captures its screen continuously and streams it over a TCP connection.
- **Remote Input Handling:**\
  Clients capture and send keyboard events, which the host processes to simulate key presses.
- **Toggle Input Feature:**\
  Clients can enable or disable the sending of key events by pressing a designated hotkey (0).
- **Graceful Disconnection:**\
  Both client and host listen for the `ESC` key to safely disconnect or shut down the session.
- **Multi-threaded Operation:**\
  Uses Python's threading library to handle multiple simultaneous client connections and concurrent tasks such as screen streaming and input processing.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.12.6 (or later)
- **Libraries:**
  - `socket` for network communication
  - `threading` for handling concurrent connections and processes
  - `keyboard` for capturing key events on the client side
  - `pyautogui` for simulating key presses on the host side
  - `mss` for high-performance screen capturing (host)
  - `cv2` (OpenCV) for displaying the streamed screen on the client
  - `pickle` and `struct` for serializing and sending image frames and messages
  - `numpy` for array manipulation in image processing
- **IDE/Editor:** Visual Studio Code (or your preferred environment)

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

2. **Install Python:**\
   Ensure Python 3.12.6 or later is installed on your system. Download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Install Required Libraries:**\
   In a terminal or command prompt inside your project directory, run:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python pyautogui keyboard mss numpy
   ```

   *(If necessary, install additional libraries with pip.)*

## Usage Guide

### Running the Host

On the host computer (ensure this machine is dedicated to hosting):

1. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python host3.py
   ```
2. The host will start streaming its screen on port **5050** and wait for client connections.
3. To stop the server and disconnect all clients, press the `ESC` key on the host machine.

### Running the Client

On the client computer:

1. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python client3.py
   ```
2. When prompted, enter the **IPv4 address** of the host computer.
3. A window will open displaying the hostâ€™s screen.
4. To toggle key input transmission (enable/disable), press the `0` key.
5. To disconnect from the host, press the `ESC` key.

> **Note:** Running host and client on the same computer is not recommended due to potential input interference.
