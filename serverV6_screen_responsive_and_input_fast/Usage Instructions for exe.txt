If you prefer not to follow the full installation guide and just want to use the program directly, you can run the .exe files included in the release.

The host executable was built using PyInstaller with the --onefile and --windowed options, so it runs without opening a terminal window.

The client executable was built with --onefile but with console output enabled, so you can see logs or debug messages during use.
